1. Complete R Lab 0 to the best of your ability and turn in the knitted version to Gradescope.
2. Bring any questions from the lab to class on Tuesday -- we will discuss in the first few minutes. 
3. We will be looking at incidence and prevalence of diseases on Tuesday. This [resource](https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/node/5277) provides a good analogy for distinguishing between the two.
4. Homework and anything else to prepare for Tuesday will be posted by Friday 9/3/2021.
