# About

As we are all painfully aware, infectious disease can play a prominent role in our lives. Statistical and computational models serve a critical role in improving understanding of the progression and proliferation of infection in a population, as well as the impact of interventions in stopping the spread of disease. This course will be split into three sections: (1) epidemiological characteristics, which will include discussion of available data, descriptive summaries of data, and some regression-based methods for modeling infection characteristics; (2) compartmental models and corresponding simulations; (3) agent-based models and corresponding simulations. Many of our examples will be motivated by some of the most impactful epidemics and pandemics in recent history, including HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19. We will make regular use of R statistical software in this class and work up to simulating infectious disease dynamics.

**Prerequisites**

STAT 140

# Policies

## General Expectations


- All individuals should wear a snug-fitting, multi-layered mask over their nose and mouth in class (at all times). If someone forgets their mask, please remind them quickly and politely.
- Refrain from eating or drinking in our shared classroom space. If you need to do so, please step outside for a quick break.
- Abide by the \href{https://www.mtholyoke.edu/opening-gates/community-compact-students}{Community Compact}.
- Understand that this remains an uncertain and difficult time for many of us; generosity, grace, and kindness will help get us all through this. 

## Attendance

Please come to class, unless you are sick. If you are sick, please let me know and stay home and rest. Please err on the side of staying home if you are feeling unwell! Many assignments are flexible enough to be completed outside of class if the need arises, so take advantage of the flexibility if you are unwell.

If you need to miss several consecutive classes because of illness, isolation protocols, or childcare issues, please email me and your Class Dean as soon as possible to make arrangements. If I need to miss class, I will email immediately to let you know. If I am not actually sick, I will hold class via Zoom. The link is on our Moodle page.

## Time commitment

You are expected to budget approximately three out-of-class hours for every credit hour to complete readings, assignments, and homework (12 hours per week time commitment). If you are spending more time than this regularly, please check in with me.


## Collaboration

Much of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own.  Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or large blocks of R code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit or a penalty.  No interaction with anyone but the instructor is allowed on any exams or quizzes.  All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Mount Holyoke College Honor Code.

To sum up: **I want you to work together** on homeworks and labs.  *But,* **you must write up your answers yourself.**

Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported.

# Technology

## Computing with R

Modern statistics can’t be done without computation. We will use the R statistical programming language in this course. R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic statistics, and I use it daily; it’s also very commonly used in statistics and data science positions in industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will use R most days, and for many homework problems. I expect that you are familiar with R from previous classes, but I do not expect that you are an expert at R yet. That said, it is imperative  that you let me know if you are confused about anything we are doing in R as soon as possible.

We will use R via RStudio. You can either download R and RStudio on your personal computer to work locally (encouraged) or you can use RStudio through Mount Holyoke's Server: \url{https://rstudio.mtholyoke.edu/}. Should you choose to do the former, make sure you have installed at least version 3.6.3 of R and the latest versions of any R libraries we use.

## Computing Grant Intervention

This course will employ an National Science Foundation Computing in Undergraduate Education grant intervention. Throughout the class, there will be some core computing topics that will be emphasized through videos developed under this grant and portions of assignments will reinforece those concepts in the context of our course subject matter. There will also be a survey that I will ask you to complete as part of the grant - more details will follow.

## Assignments

### Participation

You can participate in class in a number of ways. There is, of course, the traditional asking and answering questions in class, as well as actively contributing to group work and discussions. Other ways to participate include posting questions/answers on our discussion forum on Moodle, forming a study group outside of class, and attending office hours. Note, you do not need to participate in all of these ways every class - this list is included so that you know there are a number of valuable ways to contribute to the class and actively engage in your own learning.

### Labs

The best way to learn statistics is to do it.  This class will be built around a series of labs that we will do in class.  Although I will not grade these labs for correctness, I expect you to complete them and submit your work on Gradescope.  I will occasionally look at submitted labs to see how everyone is doing and whether there are any points I need to address in class.  I am always happy to answer any questions you have about these labs. 

### Homework

We will have regular homework assignments to be completed outside of class. **Homework will be submitted to Gradescope, and will be due on Thursday of each week.**

### Late Assignments 

While I will post due dates for assignments, there is flexibility in these due dates, so in theory you can turn any assignment in late, without penalty. Routinely turning in work more than 3 days late will make it difficult to keep up in the class. For this reason I have set Gradescope to accept work automatically up to three days after the posted due date. After that you will need to email me to reopen the assignment. If you find yourself routinely turning in late work (meaning that you need to have the assignment reopened), please talk to me so we can work towards a solution to ensure your success in the class!

### Weekly Quizzes

There will be weekly quizzes on material from class readings, lecture, and class activities/labs. These are low stakes assignments intended to measure comprehension. The assessments will be administered through Moodle. 

### Projects

There will be two projects in this class, an Epidemiological Characteristics Project, which will tentatively be due in Week 5, and a Modeling Project, which will be due at the end of the semester. More details will be posted on both projects shortly. Projects will be broken down into stages, for which subassignments will be given to keep you on track.
 

## Grading

When grading your written work, I am looking for solutions that are technically correct and reasoning that is clearly explained. *Numerically correct answers, alone, are not sufficient* on any assignments. Neatness and organization are valued, with brief, clear answers that explain your thinking. If I cannot read or follow your work, then I cannot give you full credit for it. Your grade for this course will be a weighted average of the following components:

| Item          | Weight |
| ------------- |:------:|
| Participation | 10%    |
| Labs          | 10%    |
| Homework      | 15%    |
| Quizzes       | 20%    |
| Project 1     | 20%    |
| Project 2     | 25%    |

# Accommodations

**Academic accommodations** 

AccessAbility Services is the office on campus that determines academic accommodations for students with disabilities. If you need official accommodations through AccessAbility Services, you have a right to have these met and kept confidential. Please contact AccessAbility Services, located in Mary Lyon Hall 3rd Floor, at 413-538-2634 or accessability-services@mtholyoke.edu. If you are eligible for academic accommodations, you will be provided with an accommodation letter. Once you receive your accommodation letter, I would like to meet with you and discuss these approved accommodations and our class. For more information on who might be eligible for accommodations and the application process please see the [AccessAbility Services website](www.mtholyoke.edu/accessability).

**Religious accommodations**

In support of our religiously diverse student population, students may miss a class, obtain an extension on an assignment, or reschedule an exam if there is a conflict with a religious high holiday or observance. Students should **notify me at the beginning of the module if a religious observance will require special accommodation**. 

**Audio/Visual Recording Policy**

To encourage active engagement and academic inquiry in the classroom, as well as to safeguard the privacy of students and faculty, no form of audio or visual recording in the classroom is permitted without explicit permission from the professor/instructor or without a letter from AccessAbility Services, signed by the faculty member, authorizing the recording as an accommodation. Authorized recordings may only be used by the student who has obtained permission and may not be shared or distributed for any reason. Violation of this policy is an infraction of the Mount Holyoke Honor Code and academic regulations and will result in disciplinary action.
