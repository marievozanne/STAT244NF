# Policies

## Attendance

## Time commitment

You are expected to budget approximately three out-of-class hours for every credit hour to complete readings, assignments, and homework (12 hours per week time commitment). If you are spending more time than this regularly, please check in with me.


## Collaboration

Much of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own.  Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or large blocks of R code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit or a penalty.  No interaction with anyone but the instructor is allowed on any exams or quizzes.  All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Mount Holyoke College Honor Code.

To sum up: **I want you to work together** on homeworks and labs.  *But,* **you must write up your answers yourself.**

Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported.

# Accommodations

## Academic accommodations 

AccessAbility Services is the office on campus that determines academic accommodations for students with disabilities. If you need official accommodations through AccessAbility Services, you have a right to have these met and kept confidential. Please contact AccessAbility Services, located in Mary Lyon Hall 3rd Floor, at 413-538-2634 or accessability-services@mtholyoke.edu. If you are eligible for academic accommodations, you will be provided with an accommodation letter. Once you receive your accommodation letter, I would like to meet with you and discuss these approved accommodations and our class. For more information on who might be eligible for accommodations and the application process please see the [AccessAbility Services website](www.mtholyoke.edu/accessability).

## Religious accommodations

In support of our religiously diverse student population, students may miss a class, obtain an extension on an assignment, or reschedule an exam if there is a conflict with a religious high holiday or observance. Students should **notify me at the beginning of the module if a religious observance will require special accommodation**. 

## Audio/Visual Recording Policy

To encourage active engagement and academic inquiry in the classroom, as well as to safeguard the privacy of students and faculty, no form of audio or visual recording in the classroom is permitted without explicit permission from the professor/instructor or without a letter from AccessAbility Services, signed by the faculty member, authorizing the recording as an accommodation. Authorized recordings may only be used by the student who has obtained permission and may not be shared or distributed for any reason. Violation of this policy is an infraction of the Mount Holyoke Honor Code and academic regulations and will result in disciplinary action.
